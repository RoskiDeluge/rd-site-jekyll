![Roberto Delgado Profile Picture](/img/rd_profile.png)  

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer. I started learning about the web in 1995 when I typed the URL for the Zapatistas to learn about their fight in Chiapas. As a proud student in Lambda School, I've gained experience building single page apps with React as a frontend and RESTful API Node.js as a backend. In my role as an independent consutant, I've helped my clients with their web strategy and content marketing flows.
